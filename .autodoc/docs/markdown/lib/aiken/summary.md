The `int.ak` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/lib/aiken` folder provides a utility function named `compare` that is designed to compare two integers and return their relative order as an `Ordering` enum value. The `Ordering` enum consists of three possible outcomes: `Less`, `Equal`, or `Greater`. This function can be utilized in various scenarios where integer comparison is required, such as sorting algorithms or conditional statements.

The `compare` function takes two integer arguments, `left` and `right`, and performs a comparison between them. If the `left` integer is less than the `right` integer, the function returns `Less`. If the `left` integer is greater than the `right` integer, it returns `Greater`. If both integers are equal, it returns `Equal`.

Here's an example of how the `compare` function can be used in a practical scenario:

```rust
let a = 14;
let b = 42;

match compare(a, b) {
  Ordering::Less => println!("a is less than b"),
  Ordering::Equal => println!("a is equal to b"),
  Ordering::Greater => println!("a is greater than b"),
}
```

In this example, the `compare` function is called with the values of `a` and `b` as arguments. The `match` statement then evaluates the `Ordering` value returned by the function and prints the appropriate message to the console based on the comparison result.

The `compare` function in the `int.ak` file can be a valuable addition to the larger project, as it provides a reusable and efficient way to compare integers. This function can be integrated with other parts of the project that require integer comparison, such as sorting algorithms, search algorithms, or decision-making logic. By using this function, developers can ensure consistent and accurate integer comparisons throughout the project, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
