The purpose of this function is to compare two integers and determine their relative order. \n\nThe `Ordering` type is an enum that represents the possible outcomes of a comparison: `Less`, `Equal`, or `Greater`. The function first checks if the `left` integer is less than the `right` integer. If so, it returns `Less`. If the `left` integer is greater than the `right` integer, it returns `Greater`. If the two integers are equal, it returns `Equal`.\n\nThis function can be used in a variety of contexts where integer comparison is needed. For example, it could be used in sorting algorithms to determine the order of elements in a list. It could also be used in conditional statements to perform different actions based on the relative order of two integers.\n\nHere is an example of how this function could be used:\n\n```\nlet a = 14;\nlet b = 42;\n\nmatch compare(a, b) {\n  Ordering::Less => println!(\"a is less than b\"),\n  Ordering::Equal => println!(\"a is equal to b\"),\n  Ordering::Greater => println!(\"a is greater than b\"),\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `compare` function is used to compare the values of `a` and `b`. The `match` statement then uses the `Ordering` value returned by the function to determine which message to print to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this function?** \nThis function is used to compare two integers and return an `Ordering` value indicating whether the left integer is less than, greater than, or equal to the right integer.\n\n2. **What is the expected input type for the `left` and `right` parameters?** \nThe expected input type for both `left` and `right` parameters is `Int`.\n\n3. **What is the expected output type of this function?** \nThe expected output type of this function is `Ordering`, which is an enum that represents the ordering of two values.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/lib/aiken/int.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/aiken-lang/stdlib/.autodoc/docs/json/lib/aiken)\n\nThe `int.ak` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/lib/aiken` folder provides a utility function named `compare` that is designed to compare two integers and return their relative order as an `Ordering` enum value. The `Ordering` enum consists of three possible outcomes: `Less`, `Equal`, or `Greater`. This function can be utilized in various scenarios where integer comparison is required, such as sorting algorithms or conditional statements.\n\nThe `compare` function takes two integer arguments, `left` and `right`, and performs a comparison between them. If the `left` integer is less than the `right` integer, the function returns `Less`. If the `left` integer is greater than the `right` integer, it returns `Greater`. If both integers are equal, it returns `Equal`.\n\nHere's an example of how the `compare` function can be used in a practical scenario:\n\n```rust\nlet a = 14;\nlet b = 42;\n\nmatch compare(a, b) {\n  Ordering::Less => println!(\"a is less than b\"),\n  Ordering::Equal => println!(\"a is equal to b\"),\n  Ordering::Greater => println!(\"a is greater than b\"),\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `compare` function is called with the values of `a` and `b` as arguments. The `match` statement then evaluates the `Ordering` value returned by the function and prints the appropriate message to the console based on the comparison result.\n\nThe `compare` function in the `int.ak` file can be a valuable addition to the larger project, as it provides a reusable and efficient way to compare integers. This function can be integrated with other parts of the project that require integer comparison, such as sorting algorithms, search algorithms, or decision-making logic. By using this function, developers can ensure consistent and accurate integer comparisons throughout the project, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/lib/aiken/summary.md"}}],["2",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/aiken-lang/stdlib/.autodoc/docs/json/lib)\n\nThe `int.ak` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/lib/aiken` folder provides a utility function named `compare` that is designed to compare two integers and return their relative order as an `Ordering` enum value.
